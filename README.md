# Giselle's Code Game
Masterminds is a code breaking game where a player selects a sequence of color circles to try and match the computers (code master) code (or color sequence). You will have 6 chances to guess the sequence of 4 colors correctly before youll lose the game. If you guess the code masters code on or before the 6th try you will win!


For this game I used, Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS

As I progress and get better with my code I would like to add some additional features that the original Masterminds games has such as, a key and a timer counting down. The key holds 4 pegs, they are black white and grey. These differnet colors represent if your current guess has 1) the correct colors 2) a color in the correct spot of 3) no colors match.
